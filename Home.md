# EDDiscovery – What is it and why do I need it? 

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short (and this does kinda sell it short) it’s a 3rd party that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, plot them on a series of 2D maps (included) and also plot them on a 3D map.  
  
Here’s an example of the travel history:

Nice right?  Now you don’t need to try and remember to write down the systems you went to – this can be especially important if you get yourself into a sparsely populated area of the galaxy and need to re-trace your steps to get out.  
  
But whilst a list of visited systems is useful, lets be honest, it's a bit boring.  EDDiscovery takes these visited systems and plots them on series of high quality 2D maps.  Here's an example:

Yes, those coloured lines are my travels, and yes you get to pick the colours :)  You may have noticed the coloured squares earlier in the travel log - they correlate to the lines on this map.  
  
But wait...there's more!  
There’s also a 3D version of your travels – note the plot colours are the same:  [The blue blob is basically ‘the bubble’ – each system that has a station is coloured blue by default]
