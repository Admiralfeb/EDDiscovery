# Basic Set-up
Download and install the [latest version](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Download-the-Application,-here!) - It's a typical 'next, next, finish' installer.

The first run of the application might take a little while as it will go off and download the maps that can later be used to overlay with your travels.  Just be a little a patient.
