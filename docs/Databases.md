# Overview

In EDDiscovery 5.0, it is proposed that we split the database into two databases:
* [`EDDUser` database](Databases/EDDUser.md): contains the user settings, journal entries, saved routes, bookmarks, notes, etc
* [`EDDSystems` database](Databases/EDDSystems.md): contains data imported from EDSM and EDDB.
